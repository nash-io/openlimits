# Welcome to openLimits

A Rust high performance cryptocurrency trading API with support for multiple exchanges and language wrappers.

Project goals are to be:

* Based on Rust, memory safe by default.
* Support for websockets and user defined networking.
* Thin layer wrappers for Java, C#, Python and Node.js
* Easy to add support for additional exchanges.
* Open-source only, now and forever.

**Warning**: the project is still in development and a lot of breaking changes are being made.
